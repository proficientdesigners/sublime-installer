## Usage

Start typing `b4-` in HTML files and the autocomplete window opens. It matches fuzzily. So you can type `b4btn` to find the `b4-btn` snippet.

Ensure you have enabled "b4" in your Preferences.sublime-settings:

`"auto_complete_triggers": [{"selector": "text.html", "characters": "b4"}]`

## Key Features :

  - Supports autocompletion of all helper classes in JavaScript, CSS and HTML
  - Snippet support for all components.
  - Snippet support for templates.
  - Snippet support for layout.
  - Snippet support for content.
